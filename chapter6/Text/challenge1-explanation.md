This Python code defines two classes: `Person` and `Car`.

1.  **Person Class**:
    
    -   This class represents a person with attributes `name` and `age`.
    -   The `__init__` method serves as the constructor, which initializes the `name` and `age` attributes when a new instance of the class is created.
    -   It also has a method named `greet()` which prints out a greeting message containing the person's name and age.
2.  **Car Class**:
    
    -   This class represents a car with attributes `make`, `model`, `year`, and `is_running`.
    -   The `__init__` method serves as the constructor, which initializes the `make`, `model`, and `year` attributes when a new instance of the class is created. It also initializes `is_running` attribute to `False` by default.
    -   It has two methods: `start_engine()` and `stop_engine()`, which respectively start and stop the car's engine. These methods also update the `is_running` attribute accordingly.

After defining the classes, the code creates instances of both classes and demonstrates calling methods on those instances:

-   Two instances of the `Person` class (`person1` and `person2`) are created with different names and ages, and the `greet()` method is called on each to display a greeting message.
-   Two instances of the `Car` class (`car1` and `car2`) are created with different make, model, and year. Then, the `start_engine()` method is called on both, followed by `stop_engine()` method to stop the engine.

The output demonstrates the behavior of the methods, showing messages indicating whether the engine is starting or stopping, and the details of the car or person involved.
