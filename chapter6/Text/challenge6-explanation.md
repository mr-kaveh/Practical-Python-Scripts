### Explanation

1.  **Engine Class**:
    
    -   The `Engine` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `horsepower` attribute.
        
    -   It has a `start` method that returns a string indicating the engine is starting.
        
2.  **Car Class**:
    
    -   The `Car` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `make`, `model`, and `engine` attributes. The `engine` attribute is an instance of the `Engine` class.
        
    -   The `Car` class's `start` method calls the `start` method of the `Engine` instance it contains.
        
3.  **Creating Objects**:
    
    -   An `Engine` object is created with 300 horsepower.
        
    -   A `Car` object is created, using the `Engine` object as one of its attributes.
        
4.  **Starting the Car**:
    
    -   When `my_car.start()` is called, it outputs: `"Ford Mustang: Engine with 300 horsepower starts."`, demonstrating the composed behavior.
        

### Benefits of Composition

-   **Flexibility**: You can change components independently of one another, making your code more flexible.
    
-   **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts without modification.
    
-   **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update smaller components than large, monolithic classes.
    

Composition allows you to build complex systems by combining simpler, modular components. It's a powerful tool in object-oriented programming that complements inheritance and provides a robust design structure for your Python applications.
