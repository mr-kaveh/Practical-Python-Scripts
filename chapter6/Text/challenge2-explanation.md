In this code:

-   `PortMonitor` is a base class representing a general port monitor. It has a constructor that takes `host` and `port` as parameters and a method `check_port()` that attempts to create a connection to the specified host and port.
-   `HTTPPortMonitor` is a subclass of `PortMonitor` that specializes in monitoring HTTP ports. It overrides the `check_port()` method to additionally send an HTTP request and check if the server responds with an HTTP/1.1 response.
-  `UDPPortMonitor` class that is a subclass of `PortMonitor`. This class specializes in monitoring UDP ports. It overrides the `check_port()` method to create a UDP socket and attempt to connect to the specified host and port.
-   In the example usage, we create instances of both `PortMonitor` and `HTTPPortMonitor` classes and use them to check the status of HTTP and SSH ports on a specified host (`example.com`). Finally, we print out the status of each port.
