-   **Base Class (**`Animal`**)**: This class has an `__init__` method to initialize the name attribute and a `speak` method that returns a generic message.
    
-   **Derived Class (**`Dog`**)**: This class inherits from `Animal`. It has its own `__init__` method to initialize both the name (inherited from `Animal`) and the breed. It also overrides the `speak` method to return a dog-specific message.
    
-   **Creating Instances**: We create instances of both `Animal` and `Dog` and demonstrate that the `Dog` class has all the attributes and methods of `Animal`, with additional or overridden functionality.
