# IF Statement
### 2-1-1.Introduction to if Statements
An if statement is a control structure that allows you to make decisions in your code. It evaluates a condition, and based on the result, it either executes a block of code or skips it. The if statement is an essential tool for building logic into your Python programs.
### 2-1-2.Basic if Statement
The basic structure of an if statement in Python is as follows:

	if condition:
		Code to execute if the condition is True

For Example:

		x = 10
		if x > 5:
		print("x is greater than 5")

In this example, the condition x > 5 is evaluated, and if it's True, the code inside the if block is executed, resulting in the message being printed.

### 2-1-3. if-else Statements

Sometimes, you want to execute one block of code if a condition is True and another block if it's False. This is where the if-else statement comes into play:

	if condition:
		# Code to execute if the condition is True
	else:
		# Code to execute if the condition is False
Here's an example:

	x = 3
	if x % 2 == 0:
		print("x is even")
	else:
		print("x is odd")
In this case, the program checks if x is even or odd and prints the corresponding message.

### 2-1-4. if-elif-else Statements
In more complex scenarios, you may need to evaluate multiple conditions. The if-elif-else statement allows you to handle multiple conditions in a structured way:

	if condition1:
		Code to execute if condition1 is True
	elif condition2:
		Code to execute if condition2 is True
	else:
		Code to execute if all conditions are False
Consider this example:
	
	score = 85
	if score >= 90:
		grade = 'A'
	elif score >= 80:
		grade = 'B'
	else:
		grade = 'C'
This code calculates a letter grade based on the value of the score variable.

### 2-1-5. Nested if Statements
You can nest if statements within other if statements to create more complex decision-making logic. This is particularly useful when you need to evaluate multiple conditions in a specific order.

	if condition1:
		if condition2:
			Code to execute if both conditions are True
		else:
			Code to execute if condition1 is True but condition2 is False
	else:
		Code to execute if condition1 is False

Nested if statements allow you to fine-tune the logic of your program.

### 2-1-6. *and* & *or* Operators
To evaluate multiple conditions within a single if statement, you can use the and and or operators.
The **and** operator requires both conditions to be True for the entire expression to be True.
The **or** operator requires at least one condition to be True for the entire expression to be True.

For example:

	x = 10
	y = 5
	if x > 5 and y < 7:
		print("Both conditions are True")

In this case, both conditions must be True for the message to be printed.
### 2-1-7. Ternary if Expression

Python allows for a concise way to assign values to variables based on a condition using the ternary if expression. It has the following syntax:

	variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

For example:

	x = 6
	message = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

This assigns the string "Even" to message if x is even and "Odd" if x is odd.
