#  Documentation Strings
Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
One of the key features that contributes to its user-friendliness is the concept of documentation strings, often referred to as "docstrings."
Docstrings are a valuable tool for creating clear and concise documentation for your Python code,
helping others (and your future self) understand how your code works, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.
