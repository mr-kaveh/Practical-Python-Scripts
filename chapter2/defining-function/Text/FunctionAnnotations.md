#  Function Annotations

Python is a versatile and dynamic programming language known for its readability and ease of use. While Python's dynamically-typed nature is one of its strengths, 
it can sometimes lead to confusion and bugs, particularly in larger codebases or when working in teams. To address this issue and make code more understandable, 
Python introduced function annotations. Function annotations are a powerful feature that allows you to add hints and information about the types and purpose of 
function parameters and return values, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Understanding Function Annotations

Function annotations are a feature in Python that allows you to attach metadata, including type information and explanatory text, to function arguments and return values. 
You can use function annotations to provide hints about the intended data types and to clarify the purpose of the parameters and return values in your functions. 
Annotations are completely optional, and they don't affect the runtime behavior of your code. They serve as a form of documentation and can be accessed through introspection,
making them a valuable tool for developers and tools that work with Python code.

Here's a basic example of a function with annotations:

	def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
		"""Add two integers and return their sum."""
		return a + b


In the example above, the 'add' function has two arguments (a and b), each annotated with int, indicating that they should be integers. The return value is annotated with int as well, 
specifying that the function returns an integer. The docstring provides additional information about the function's purpose.
