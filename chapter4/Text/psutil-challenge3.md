`psutil` is a cross-platform Python library that provides an interface for retrieving information on system utilization, such as CPU, memory, disks, network, and sensors. It allows developers to access and retrieve system-related information in a consistent and platform-independent manner.

Key features of `psutil` include:

1.  **Process Management:**
    
    -   `psutil` allows you to retrieve information about running processes, such as process ID (PID), name, memory usage, CPU usage, and more.
    -   It provides functions to interact with and monitor processes, like terminating or suspending them.
2.  **System Information:**
    
    -   You can gather information about the system as a whole, including CPU count, memory usage, disk partitions, network interfaces, and battery status (on laptops).
3.  **Real-time Monitoring:**
    
    -   `psutil` allows you to monitor system resources in real-time, making it useful for building system monitoring tools and applications.
4.  **Cross-Platform Support:**
    
    -   One of the strengths of `psutil` is its cross-platform compatibility. It works on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and BSD, providing a consistent API regardless of the underlying platform.

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use `psutil` to retrieve CPU and memory information:
	
	import psutil

	# Get CPU information
	cpu_info = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1, percpu=True)
	print(f"CPU Usage: {cpu_info}%")

	# Get Memory information
	memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
	print(f"Total Memory: {memory_info.total / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB")
	print(f"Used Memory: {memory_info.used / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB")
	print(f"Free Memory: {memory_info.free / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB")

In this example, the `psutil.cpu_percent` function is used to get the CPU usage, and `psutil.virtual_memory` is used to get information about virtual memory usage. The library provides a wide range of functions for accessing various system-related information, making it a valuable tool for system monitoring and management tasks in Python applications.
