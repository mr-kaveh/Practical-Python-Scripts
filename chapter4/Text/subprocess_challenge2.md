In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. It serves as a convenient interface for interacting with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script. The `subprocess` module is part of the standard library and is commonly used for executing external commands, including system utilities and shell commands.

Key components of the `subprocess` module include:

1.  **`subprocess.run` function:**
    
    -   The `run` function is a high-level function introduced in Python 3.5 that simplifies the process of running a command and collecting its output.
    -   It takes a list of command-line arguments as input, and it can capture the standard output, standard error, and return code of the executed command.
2.  **`subprocess.Popen` class:**
    
    -   For more fine-grained control over the execution of a process, you can use the `Popen` class.
    -   This class allows you to spawn a new process, interact with its input/output/error streams, and wait for it to complete.
    -   It provides methods and attributes for controlling and communicating with the subprocess.
3.  **Error Handling:**
    
    -   The `subprocess` module raises exceptions such as `subprocess.CalledProcessError` when a called process returns a non-zero exit code. This allows for proper error handling in your Python script.
4.  **Piping and Redirection:**
    
    -   The module supports the piping of input/output between the calling script and the subprocess.
    -   You can redirect standard input, standard output, and standard error streams using various arguments and methods.

Here is a simple example using `subprocess` to execute an external command:

	import subprocess

	try:
	    result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
	    print("Command Output:")
	    print(result.stdout)
	except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
	    print(f"Error: Command failed with return code {e.returncode}")

In this example, the `run` function is used to execute the 'ls -l' command, and the output is captured and printed. The `check=True` parameter raises an exception if the command returns a non-zero exit code, allowing for proper error handling.
